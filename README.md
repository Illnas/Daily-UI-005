Daily UI 005


So, the challenge here was to create app icon. Pretty simple challenge at first sight, but this challenge
was hard. I mean, it was hard in a way that you had to think about product first. Icon represents product, and it 
needs to be distinguishable from other app icons on your phone. First thing you will notice here was that I did 
not scale it for mobile usage, and reason for it was pretty simple; my icon is easily adjustable! And since I did create few
projects based on "Animal Kingdom", I decided to use first letter of each word, in app icon.

Now, you might have been wondering "Why not use image related to animals or wildlife?"; well, I don't know any tool that could do that. Lemme rephrase 
that, I don't have any knowledge in using any of those tools! Meaning, I will have to learn at least one tool
(Photoshop I got my eyes on you!). 

Man, each project I do in this Daily UI Challenge series makes me understand just how complex Web Design is and how much
it asks of you to be well wersed in many other technologies (like Photoshop)!

Well, lemme see what next Challenge brings. See ya there!
